This is my personal website and blog, written in PHP and Laravel.

This project started with me, tradititionally being mostly versed in programming backend projects, attempting to make myself a website and realizing how little I knew about web-development. After modifying and changing directions for the site many times over the course of about a year, I finally built up my skills in CSS and front-end development to where I am proud at what I have achieved with this project.

Everything on this website (with a few exceptions on the welcome page) is being stored and retrieved dynamically from a database, and the website has many social features, including the ability to create a profile, login, comment, create a post, like/dislike a post, and there are other security features including a roles system as well.

(Note: some of the features aren't currently deployed to the hosted version of the site as I am still working on verifying the security and integrity )

I will be writing up more about this project on the site itsself, http://www.dylanclements.com/projects (whoa, meta.)
